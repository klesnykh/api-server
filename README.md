## Lab 04 peer review
- my partner was joel myrtle
- I didn't really have key takeaways, I just explained what was going on in his code and told him how to change his code up and why. I think teaching others is a good way to get better yourself
- me checking out Joels code and pull request: https://github.com/JMyrtil/api-server/pull/1
- him checking out my code and his pull request: https://github.com/klesnykh/api-server/pull/3
